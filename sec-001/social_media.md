# 🔹 **LinkedIn – Main Profile**

> Sometimes the real challenge in IT isn’t security… it’s *compatibility*.
> I ran into a case where RHEL 9 (in FIPS mode) had to talk to an older Windows server — and upgrading wasn’t an option.
> Dropping to LEGACY wasn’t acceptable.
>
> So I built a custom crypto policy that kept FIPS-level restrictions while enabling just one legacy cipher suite.
>
> Clean, minimal, auditable.
