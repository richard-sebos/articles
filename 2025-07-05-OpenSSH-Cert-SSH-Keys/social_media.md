🚨 **Stop Reusing Old SSH Keys — Start Using Expiring SSH Certificates!** 🚨

Are your SSH keys still floating around with no expiration date?
If a private key leaks, attackers could have indefinite access to your servers.

I just published a step-by-step guide on using **OpenSSH Signing CA** to create **expiring SSH authentication keys** — keeping your Linux boxes more secure and your keys short-lived. 🛡️

Check it out if you care about Linux security or DevOps best practices.

🔐 **How to Improve SSH Security with Expiring Keys and OpenSSH Signing CAs** 🔐

One of the biggest blind spots in Linux security is how often SSH keys are created and never rotated or expired. A leaked private key could give someone access to critical infrastructure **forever**.

I've written a detailed, practical guide on how to leverage **Signing Certificate Authorities (CA) in OpenSSH** to create **short-lived, expiring SSH authentication keys.**

Why does this matter?
✅ Enforces expiry dates on keys
✅ Supports Just-in-Time access
✅ Reduces risk of credential leaks

If you're in **DevOps, Linux administration, or cybersecurity,** this is a must-read.
