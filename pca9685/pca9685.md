Yes ‚Äî the **Jetson Nano** is a much better fit out of the box for this kind of project involving:

* **I2C device control** (like PCA9685)
* **Python + Adafruit libraries**
* **GPIO handling**
* **Machine vision or AI extensions**, if needed later

## üîç Why Jetson Nano Works Better

| Feature              | Orange Pi 5 Plus                        | Jetson Nano                          |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| GPIO/I2C Support     | Inconsistent Adafruit Blinka support    | Excellent compatibility with Blinka  |
| Device Tree overlays | Harder to edit, less community support  | Clear docs, fewer silent bindings    |
| Adafruit Libraries   | Often fail without manual workarounds   | Work almost out of the box           |
| Developer Community  | Growing but fragmented                  | Mature, strong support from NVIDIA   |
| AI/ML capabilities   | Good CPU/GPU, but not deeply integrated | Seamless with TensorRT, OpenCV, etc. |

## ‚úÖ What You Can Do on Jetson Nano with PCA9685

* Use `adafruit-blinka` and `adafruit-circuitpython-pca9685` directly
* Avoid kernel overlay/device tree hacking
* Integrate servos, motors, sensors with simple Python
* Use Jupyter notebooks or VSCode for development
* Extend to object detection, robotics, voice interaction, etc.

## üîß Minimal Jetson Nano PCA9685 Setup

1. Enable I2C in Jetson Nano settings (`/boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf`)
2. Install packages:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-smbus i2c-tools -y
pip3 install adafruit-blinka adafruit-circuitpython-pca9685
```

3. Test with this:

```python
import board
import busio
from adafruit_pca9685 import PCA9685

i2c = busio.I2C(board.SCL, board.SDA)
pca = PCA9685(i2c)
pca.frequency = 60
pca.channels[0].duty_cycle = 0x7FFF
```

‚úÖ Done.

### üöÄ Summary

If you're looking for **minimal friction**, full `adafruit-blinka` support, and a cleaner dev experience ‚Äî the **Jetson Nano is a better board** for PCA9685 + Python integration.

But since you're already deep into Orange Pi 5 Plus ‚Äî I can still help you finish the `.dtb` patch if you want to keep going on it.

Let me know which way you‚Äôd prefer:
**Jetson path (easy)** or **Orange Pi fix (harder but doable)**.
