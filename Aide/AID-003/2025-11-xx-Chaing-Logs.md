Fantastic — that’s a major milestone 🎉

Now that your modular AIDE automation system is working end-to-end (baseline verification, historical audit, logging, hashing, signing, and ledger chaining), you’re ready for a clean, professional **overview article** to tie it all together.

Below is a fully written draft that matches your established tone — *technical, practical, and narrative-driven* — perfect as the next post in your AIDE series.

# **AIDE Automation Framework: From Integrity Checks to Self-Verification**

### *Modular scripting, cryptographic signing, and a tamper-evident ledger for Linux integrity management*

> *When it comes to integrity, trust isn’t a setting — it’s a habit.*
> This framework turns AIDE from a passive checker into a proactive guardian, verifying its own past before it trusts the present.

## 🧰 Introduction — Beyond File Integrity

Most Linux administrators install AIDE to detect file changes.
But detection is only part of the story — *proving that your integrity checks themselves haven’t been tampered with* is what transforms monitoring into **assurance**.

This project takes AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) and wraps it with a **modular automation framework** that:

* Signs and verifies its own baseline database,
* Hashes and signs every integrity report,
* Verifies the full history of logs before each run,
* Chains every result into a tamper-evident ledger,
* And automates it all with `systemd` timers.

The result: a self-verifying integrity system that can detect unauthorized changes — even if an attacker tries to cover their tracks.

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

The framework is built around small, single-purpose Bash modules stored in `/opt/aide/`, each handling one responsibility.

**Core directories**

```
/opt/aide/               # Automation scripts
/var/log/aide/           # Output and ledger
├── logs/                # Daily AIDE reports
├── hashes/              # SHA512 hash files
└── sigs/                # GPG signatures
/root/.aide/             # Protected baseline and signatures
```

**Shared configuration:**
`/opt/aide/aide-vars.sh`
contains all variables, ensuring consistency and auto-creating missing directories.

## ⚙️ Modular Script Design

Each module can be run independently or chained by the main driver script `aide-daily-check.sh`.

| Script                      | Purpose                                                   |
| :-------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| **aide-vars.sh**            | Common variables, directory creation, permissions         |
| **aide-verify-baseline.sh** | Verifies AIDE database signature before use               |
| **aide-verify-history.sh**  | Confirms all previous logs, hashes, and ledger are intact |
| **aide-run-check.sh**       | Runs `aide --check` and logs results                      |
| **aide-create-hash.sh**     | Generates SHA512 hash and GPG signature for current log   |
| **aide-update-ledger.sh**   | Chains new hash into ledger and re-signs it               |
| **aide-init.sh**            | Creates or rebuilds AIDE baseline                         |
| **aide-sign-baseline.sh**   | Hashes and signs the new baseline securely                |

This modular approach makes testing, maintenance, and auditing straightforward — each script does one thing well.

## 🔄 Workflow: From Baseline to Ledger

A complete AIDE run now follows a strict sequence of trust:

1. **Verify AIDE baseline** (`aide-verify-baseline.sh`)
   Ensures the baseline database hasn’t been replaced or tampered with.

2. **Verify historical records** (`aide-verify-history.sh`)
   Checks all stored logs, hashes, and ledger signatures for authenticity.

3. **Run AIDE check** (`aide-run-check.sh`)
   Executes `aide --check` and records all findings to `/var/log/aide/logs/`.

4. **Sign and hash the results** (`aide-create-hash.sh`)
   Creates verifiable `.sha512` and `.sig` files for every run.

5. **Update the ledger** (`aide-update-ledger.sh`)
   Appends the new hash and cross-links it to the previous entry, signing the ledger to preserve continuity.

6. **Daily automation** (`systemd` timer)
   Schedules the process to run automatically and logs status to the system journal.

## 🔐 Cryptographic Chain of Trust

Every step in the workflow produces cryptographic proof:

| Artifact               | Protection                                    |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **AIDE baseline**      | Signed with GPG and locked with `chattr +i`   |
| **Daily logs**         | Individually hashed (SHA512) and signed       |
| **Ledger**             | Chain-linked hashes, signed after each update |
| **Verification phase** | Ensures all prior proofs remain valid         |

This creates a **tamper-evident timeline**: even if an attacker gained root access and deleted logs, any missing link in the chain would be immediately detected.

## 🧱 Operational Automation with `systemd`

Two simple unit files complete the automation:

### `/etc/systemd/system/aide-daily-check.service`

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Run daily AIDE integrity check and ledger update
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/opt/aide/aide-daily-check.sh
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal
```

### `/etc/systemd/system/aide-daily-check.timer`

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Schedule AIDE daily integrity check

[Timer]
OnCalendar=daily
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

Enable with:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now aide-daily-check.timer
```

## 🧭 Conclusion — The System That Trusts Itself

With this framework in place, your Linux host doesn’t just detect changes — it proves, cryptographically, that its own integrity checks are authentic.
Each new run is chained to the previous one, building a verifiable timeline of trust.

> “If AIDE is the witness, this framework is the court reporter — recording every statement, verifying every signature, and never forgetting what was said.”

This approach scales naturally: you can federate multiple systems, collect signed ledgers centrally, and build an enterprise-grade audit trail — all starting from a handful of Bash scripts.
