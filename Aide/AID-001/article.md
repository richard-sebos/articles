# 🧱 Every File Deserves a Fingerprint – AIDE on Oracle Linux 9

## 🔍 Why File Integrity Still Matters
- First heard of 
System logs can lie. Attackers can clean traces. But file fingerprints don’t.  
Every binary, config, and script has a cryptographic identity — and when that identity changes, it means something changed your system.

**AIDE** (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) builds and compares those fingerprints, letting you detect tampering or unexpected modification even on a headless server.

If ProofTrail tracks integrity across qubes, AIDE is its classic ancestor — proving trust, one file at a time.

---

## ⚙️ Step 1 — Install AIDE

AIDE is available in Oracle Linux 9 repositories by default.

```bash
sudo dnf update -y
sudo dnf install aide -y
````

This installs the configuration at `/etc/aide.conf`
and creates a working directory at `/var/lib/aide/`.

---

## 🧩 Step 2 — Initialize Your Baseline

Run AIDE once to build the first **database of checksums** —
your system’s initial fingerprint.

```bash
sudo aide --init
sudo mv /var/lib/aide/aide.db.new.gz /var/lib/aide/aide.db.gz
```

That file now holds cryptographic hashes (SHA256, by default)
for thousands of files across the OS.

---

## 🔎 Step 3 — Verify Integrity

Run a check to compare the current filesystem to your baseline.

```bash
sudo aide --check | less
```

You’ll see a summary like:

```
AIDE found differences between database and filesystem!!

Added entries:
    /etc/cron.d/aide
Changed entries:
    /var/log/messages
```

Those lines mean AIDE noticed a difference — in this case, a new cron job and an updated log file.

---

## 🧪 Step 4 — See It Catch a Change

Let’s make a harmless modification and rerun the check.

```bash
sudo touch /etc/testfingerprint
sudo aide --check | grep testfingerprint
```

Expected output:

```
Added entries:
    /etc/testfingerprint
```

That’s integrity in action — a single added file, immediately noticed.

Clean up afterward:

```bash
sudo rm /etc/testfingerprint
sudo aide --update
sudo mv /var/lib/aide/aide.db.new.gz /var/lib/aide/aide.db.gz
```

---

## 🧠 Step 5 — Keep Your Baseline Safe

Copy `/var/lib/aide/aide.db.gz` somewhere read-only or encrypted.
That database is your **baseline witness** — if it’s altered, the entire trust chain collapses.

```bash
sudo cp /var/lib/aide/aide.db.gz /mnt/secure/aide.db.gz
```

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** store a copy on a USB key or encrypted LUKS volume — the old-school version of a Vault Qube.

---

## 🧭 What You Just Built

You’ve created your first **verifiable fingerprint** of a running system —
a cryptographic baseline proving that your machine is exactly what you think it is.

This is the same logic the upcoming **ProofTrail** framework extends across isolated Qubes and cloud workloads.
Integrity starts with one checksum.
