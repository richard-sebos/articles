That makes sense 👍 — if you don’t have **Active Directory** or a **Domain Controller** handy, those two topics (#7 Integrating with AD, #9 Samba as a DC) would be really tough to demo or test.

You can still make a **strong 10-article series** without them by focusing on **security, monitoring, and real-world admin tasks** that are more relevant to your lab and your readers.

Here’s a **revised 10-article path** that avoids AD/DC but still goes **beginner → advanced**:

## 🔟 Suggested Samba Series (No AD/DC Needed)

1. **What Is Samba & Why Use It?**
   – Quick history, where it fits, common use cases.

2. **Installing Samba on Linux**
   – Walkthrough for RHEL/Oracle/Ubuntu.

3. **Getting Started with smb.conf**
   – Global settings vs share definitions, your first working config.

4. **Creating & Securing Your First Share**
   – Private vs public shares, group-based access.

5. **Samba User Management Made Simple**
   – Adding users, mapping Linux to Samba, password management.

6. **Permissions & ACLs in Samba**
   – How file permissions, groups, and Samba ACLs work together.

7. **Securing Samba in the Real World**
   – Disable guest, restrict networks, firewall, SELinux basics.

8. **Performance Tuning & Quotas**
   – Socket options, async I/O, quotas per user/group.

9. **Auditing & Monitoring Samba Activity**
   – Using logs, `smbstatus`, fail2ban, monitoring with Grafana/Prometheus.

10. **Hardening Samba for Production**
    – Encrypting traffic, SMB signing, compliance tips, practical security checklist.

## ✅ Benefits of This Path

* All articles are **testable in your lab** (no AD/DC required).
* Covers the **full lifecycle**: setup → management → security → monitoring → hardening.
* At the end, readers get a **usable Samba deployment** they can adapt to business or homelab use.

👉 If you want, I can **expand each article into a blog-ready outline** (intro, sections, code/config snippets, conclusion) so you’d have a ready-to-write roadmap.

Do you want me to build those outlines for all 10, or would you prefer I draft just the **first 3 basics** so you can test the flow before committing to the full series?
