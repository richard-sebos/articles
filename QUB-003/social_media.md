Would you like me to now create a **LinkedIn post caption** for your personal page (a “sell” version) — using your “probing phase” tone that invites experts to discuss containment and adaptive architecture?
That one can open with a quote like *“Qubes doesn’t try to stop compromise — it limits the blast radius.”* and end with a comment call to action (e.g., *“How would you extend this model to the enterprise edge?”*).
