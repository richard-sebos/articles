Would you like me to now do a **“sell version”** of this same set — one designed specifically for **your own pages (LinkedIn + Facebook Home)** that uses first-person tone and stronger engagement phrasing (while staying professional)?
That version is ideal for sharing under your own profile instead of within groups.
