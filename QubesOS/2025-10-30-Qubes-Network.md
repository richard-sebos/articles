# üß± Securing the Network in QubesOS: Architecture, Routing, and Real-World Tests

> *‚ÄúA deep dive into QubesOS network isolation and how to verify your VPN, TOR, and inter-VM firewalling actually works.‚Äù*

## üìù Introduction
I began my IT career as a client/server programmer before transitioning into Linux system administration. More recently, I‚Äôve been focusing on deepening my knowledge of networking ‚Äî an area filled with concepts like subnetting, CIDR, ingress, egress, MTU, and VLANs. At first, these felt like abstract jargon. But as the landscape of cybersecurity evolves, the importance of understanding these fundamentals has become crystal clear.

AI has radically accelerated the pace of threat evolution. Modern attacks aren‚Äôt just faster ‚Äî they‚Äôre adaptive, capable of learning and pivoting in real time. Defensive systems can barely log a packet before the threat has already morphed. In this new environment, more detection isn‚Äôt the answer. Architecture is.

## QubesOS embraces that philosophy
QubesOS embraces that philosophy. It doesn‚Äôt rely on the hope that software won‚Äôt break ‚Äî it assumes compromise is inevitable and minimizes the impact. Each virtual machine operates as an isolated zone, with tightly controlled networking where every packet must earn its way out.

Over the past few weeks, I‚Äôve been putting that model to the test: tracing VPN, TOR, and firewall flows, verifying isolation boundaries, and looking for weaknesses. This isn‚Äôt just another lab experiment ‚Äî it‚Äôs a real-world exploration of how we can build AI-resilient containment systems. Architectures that adapt as fast as the threats they‚Äôre designed to survive.

## üåê QubesOS Networking Basics

QubesOS works by splitting your computer into separate compartments, each with its own virtual network connection. Only one part of the system is allowed to talk directly to the physical network, and it passes network access to the others, acting like a secure gatekeeper.

| **Component**      | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`sys-net`**      | - Connects directly to the physical network interface.<br>- Provides NAT and internal IPs to other VMs.<br>- Subnets the internal network for isolation.<br>- From the outside, all traffic appears to come from `sys-net`. |
| **`sys-firewall`** | - Filters traffic between AppVMs and `sys-net`.<br>- You can view its firewall rules with:<br>`bash<br>qvm-firewall sys-firewall<br>`<br>- Uses QubesOS `qvm` tools for rule management (more in future articles).          |
| **`sys-vpn`**      | - Clone of `sys-net` with OpenVPN configured.<br>- VPN starts automatically on boot.<br>- Any VM using `sys-vpn` routes traffic through the VPN.                                                                            |
| **`sys-whonix`**   | - Routes network traffic through the Tor network.<br>- Provides anonymity for VMs using it.<br>- Some websites may block or restrict Tor traffic.                                                                           |


###  `sys-net`
sys-net uses the physical network interface to connect to you network.
Other VMs use NAT and get internal IPs from sys-net.
It uses subnetting  to carve up the network into isolated subnet of IP address
From the outside, it looks like all traffic comes from sys-net.

 ## `sys-firewall`
 - is a VM that filter traffic between `sys-net` and VMs
 - to check the firewall ruls you can use
```bash
qvm-firewall sys-firewall
```
QubesOS has a list of `qvm` command to check different aspects off the Qube VM.  More to come in future articles
##  `sys-vpn`
- `sys-vpn` is a clone of `sys-net` that a added a OpenVPN service to.
- It OpenVPN service start automatically on VM startup and any VM using `sys-vpn` for network access goes through the VPN.

##`sys-whonix`
- `sys-whonix` is a network proxy that routes traffic out the TOR network.
- This allow VM traffice to be hidden on the TOR network
- This can cause problems for with some website the discomanate against TOR traffic.

## üì° Network Flow and Egress IP Mapping

- I ran test to find out what the IP address were assigned to the differet network interface and proxies

| VM           | Internal IP      | NetVM Used   | External IP   |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| sys-net      | 172.20.10.3/28   | (physical)   | 199.189.94.43 |
| sys-firewall | 10.138.22.13     | sys-net      | 199.189.94.43 |
| work         | 10.137.0.15/32   | sys-firewall | 199.189.94.43 |
| untrusted    | 10.137.0.16/32   | sys-firewall | 199.189.94.43 |
| sys-vpn      | 10.137.0.26/32   | sys-firewall | 45.84.107.74  |
| whonix       | 10.138.38.126/32 | sys-whonix   | 45.148.10.111 |
- Notice the IP address for the proxies have a /32 which  can't assign another host inside that subnet.

## üîí Security Verification Tests

Add hands-on tests you performed and their results:

### ‚úÖ 1. Inter-VM Isolation Test

* Tried `ping` or `curl` from `work` ‚Üí `untrusted`
* Checked `sys-firewall` logs
* ‚úÖ Confirmed firewall drops traffic

### ‚úÖ 2. VPN Leak Test

* Verified VPN IP via `curl ifconfig.me`
* Disabled OpenVPN tunnel to test failsafe
* ‚úÖ Ensured no fallback to real IP

### ‚úÖ 3. TOR Verification

* Used `whonix` to check external IP
* ‚úÖ Verified TOR network in use

### ‚úÖ 4. DNS Leak Check

* Ran DNS leak test from VPN and Whonix AppVMs
* ‚úÖ DNS resolved only via VPN/TOR

You can expand each with terminal output, e.g.:

```bash
[user@work ~]$ curl ifconfig.me
199.189.94.43
```

## üìã Firewall Log Example

Insert your actual `journalctl` output when you tested isolation:

```text
Oct 19 15:30:22 sys-firewall kernel: QUBES DROP: IN=vif12.0 OUT=vif14.0 MAC=... SRC=10.137.0.15 DST=10.137.0.16 ...
```

Explain what it shows: inter-VM traffic denied by default.

## üó∫Ô∏è Diagram: Visualizing the Network

Create or insert a diagram that shows:

* AppVMs
* ProxyVMs
* IP addresses
* Direction of traffic (arrows)
* VPN/TOR exit points

> *(You can ask me to generate one from your data if you‚Äôd like.)*

---

## üí° Lessons Learned & Tips

Share what you found insightful, frustrating, or surprising. Some ideas:

* Using `/32` IPs for AppVMs makes them logically isolated
* Even on the same subnet, firewall rules prevent VM-to-VM traffic
* VPN failsafe is not built-in ‚Äî needs explicit `iptables` rules
* `sys-net` is never to be trusted ‚Äî it's the attack surface

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

After weeks of tracing traffic, logging drops, and intentionally breaking things, one truth stands out: **Qubes doesn‚Äôt try to stop compromise ‚Äî it limits the blast radius.** That containment mindset is the pattern cybersecurity needs as threats accelerate.

I‚Äôm still in the probing phase ‚Äî mapping how these design principles might translate beyond Qubes into more adaptive, automated defenses. If you‚Äôve experimented with similar setups or uncovered unexpected behaviors, I‚Äôd love to hear about them. Drop your observations, scripts, or lessons learned in the comments or DM me ‚Äî I‚Äôm collecting real-world trade-offs and community insights for a follow-up piece.
