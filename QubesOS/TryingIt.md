# Qubes OS: My Journey Toward a “Reasonably Secure Operating System”

## Introduction: Shattering the Myth

A few years ago, an IT professional I trusted made a statement that stuck with me: *Linux is not secure.* He didn’t mean that Linux was inherently less secure than Windows or macOS, but rather that—like every operating system—it comes with flaws and misconfigurations by default.

That comment shattered a long-held belief of mine. For years I had teased Windows users about their security problems, only to realize that my own trusted system wasn’t flawless. It was a turning point that sent me down the path of asking: *what can I do to better secure my systems?*

Today, years later, I’m writing this article not on a standard Linux distribution, but on **Qubes OS**.

## Qubes OS at a Glance

Qubes OS bills itself as *“a reasonably secure operating system.”* That slogan sounds vague at first, but it’s also surprisingly accurate. Many articles and videos go further, calling it *the most secure Linux distribution*. That’s a bold claim given the existence of hardened and ephemeral Linux distros, but Qubes OS does offer something unique.

At a high level, Qubes OS security is based on:

* **Hardware isolation**: It relies on CPUs with virtualization extensions (Intel VT-x/VT-d or AMD-V/AMD-Vi) to separate virtual machines at the hardware level.
* **Dom0 (Domain 0)**: When you log in, you enter dom0, a minimal and highly restricted domain. It runs the desktop and Qubes Manager but has no network access.
* **Qubes (VMs)**: Applications and services run in isolated qubes (virtual machines). If one qube is compromised, others remain unaffected.
* **Service qubes**: Networking is routed through specialized qubes like `sys-net` and `sys-firewall`, which restrict exposure and enforce separation.

This approach can be a bit mind-bending at first, but in a good way. Qubes OS gives you a safe space to “do something dumb” when needed—without risking your entire system.

## When a Qube Doesn’t Feel Like a VM

At first, I assumed Qubes OS was just another hypervisor like Proxmox or QEMU. After all, everything in Qubes OS runs inside virtual machines. But there’s a key difference: when you launch an application in a qube, it feels like a native desktop app, not like working inside a separate VM window.

This seamless integration is what sets Qubes OS apart. You can alt-tab between apps that technically live in different qubes, and file managers in separate qubes can interact in ways that don’t feel foreign. It gives you the security of virtualization with the usability of a single desktop.

## Why Have Qubes?

I like to think of qubes as the digital equivalent of firewall zones. Where a firewall filters network traffic, a qube isolates applications and workflows.

Here are some examples from my setup:

* **Work Qube**: Used for writing and publishing tasks.
* **Personal Qube**: Runs email via Thunderbird.
* **Untrusted Qube**: A sandbox for scanning USB drives with ClamAV.

Each qube feels like a standalone environment. Switching between windows is natural. There’s a slight delay when launching a new qube, especially on older hardware, but once it’s running, the experience feels fluid.

## The Downsides

After just two days of use, the downsides haven’t been dealbreakers, but they are worth mentioning.

The first surprise came right after installation: when I plugged in a USB mouse, Qubes OS asked if I wanted to grant it access to dom0. It reminded me of Windows Vista’s constant security prompts. The reason is `sys-usb`, a dedicated USB qube that isolates devices like mice and thumb drives. It adds friction, but in exchange, external devices are treated as untrusted by default.

Other challenges include:

* **Clipboard sharing**: Copy and paste between qubes works only if you configure rules.
* **App startup delays**: If a qube isn’t running, opening an app takes longer.
* **Browser separation**: Each qube has its own Firefox profile, including bookmarks. Great for security, slightly annoying for convenience.

These inconveniences are trade-offs, but they reinforce the philosophy of isolation and intentionality.

## Who Is Qubes OS For?

Qubes OS isn’t aimed at the average user. Its target audience is journalists, activists, and cybersecurity professionals—people who need strong isolation guarantees and who don’t mind some friction in exchange for security.

It installs with disk encryption by default and supports easy creation, cloning, backup, and deletion of qubes. This makes it possible to spin up a qube for a specific task, do what is need, and then destroy it afterward, leaving not foot print.

VPN integration is simple too: I was able to drop in an OpenVPN config and route an entire qube through it. While the system supports certain providers out of the box, manual configuration works fine for others.

## Final Thoughts

I expected the security model to be the wow factor of Qubes OS, and while it is impressive, what surprised me most was how seamless the user experience felt. Application windows from different qubes coexist naturally on the same desktop, creating the illusion of a single environment.

Yes, copy-and-paste restrictions and startup delays take some adjustment, but they also encourage me to pause and think: *what is the security risk here, and what am I willing to allow?* That mindfulness seems part of the design.

Qubes OS truly lives up to its motto: it is *“a reasonably secure operating system”*—and in today’s threat landscape, that’s a lot to say.
