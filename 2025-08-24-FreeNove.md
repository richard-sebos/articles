- I started working on a project with motor controller and and was having an issues connection them to either a Jetson Orin or a Orange Pi 5 plus so I thought I would take a step back and try 
- it had been years since I had played with an ESP32 and I had older boards, went looking for updated ESP32 boards
- while I was searching I can across Freenove Breakout Board and added to the cart
- it was definitely an impulse by based on frustrations I had in the past but in the end, I was happy I bought it and here is why

## ESP 32 Size
- the ESP32 is great as a standard tool and it helped debug my motorl controller issue but it is a weird size for breadboards
- It is too larger for single breadboard but does work well across two side by side
- The Freenove Breakout Board was the right size for the project I was working on.

- This was more going to be a debugging/learning project, creating a permitted board was not needed

## Why I like the Freenove Breakout Board 
- I am a tinker, which I move from project to project as my interest is at the mercy or my attention span
- With the ESP32 controlling to L982N motor controllers, I know i would be using at least 12 pins
- and was using the ESP32 on a metal robot chase and was looking for a way to mount the board
- The Freenove Breakout Board worked nicely

### Three Row of Headers
- the board has three rows of headers to fit ESP of different sizes, which worked since I do have ESP32 of different widths
- Once the ESP32 is mounted on the board, there are pins connected the to the ESP32.
- It has 24 pins per side and are label L1-L24
- Once connected, the wiring stay on and Iwas do a but of tracing wirers.

## External Power
- It does used extenal power and take 6v to 24v, my 12v adport work fine
- it allows you to set the board to 3v or 5v using jumpers
- Each side of the board can have it's own power level
- there are three row of points per side and each pin on the ESP32 can be mapper to ether
    - red point power
    - black pin common
    - yellow connects to the ESP32
- So when you need to provide power to ESP32, you jumper the red point to the yellow in VCC and black to yellow for ground
