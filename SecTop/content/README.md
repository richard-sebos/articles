## 🧠 Notes
- Keep *Legacy* articles practical and searchable (commands, sysadmin tasks).  
- *Edge* articles should focus on **proof, verification, architecture, and cryptographic mindset**.  
- Breadcrumbs are narrative glue — link past and future posts to show your journey in real time.  
- Every 2–3 weeks: review performance and shift focus toward what’s resonating most.
