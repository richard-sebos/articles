## ðŸ§­ Mission Statement (Updated)

I've been exploring Linux for over a decade, but until now, my path has been scattered â€” jumping from topic to topic without a clear direction. With this project, Iâ€™m shifting gears.

Over the next 5 to 10 years, I believe cybersecurity threats will become one of the most pressing challenges we face. I want to prove â€” to myself and to others â€” that it's possible to build an **enterprise-grade secure laptop** using open-source tools that protect everyday users from whatâ€™s coming. This project is my commitment to focus, depth, and execution.

It starts with **QubesOS** as the operating system foundation, and Iâ€™m expanding into hardware-based security with tools like **YubiKey**. While QubesOS has limitations â€” especially around `dom0` access and usability â€” I see it as a strong core for designing layered, tamper-evident systems.

I believe Linux users have access to many great security tools â€” but theyâ€™re often missing, misconfigured, or ignored. This creates a **false sense of security** for new users. I want to provide practical **information, scripts, and secure-by-default setups** that go far beyond tips like "run updates" or "set up backups."

My long-term goal is to help grow this space beyond niche users â€” to turn **secure Linux computing** from an elite skill into an **accessible, repeatable framework**.
