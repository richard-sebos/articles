# 🧩 **ProofTrail 5 (Bonus)** — *“Git as a Witness: Turning Version Control Into a Verification Ledger”*

### 🎯 Goal

Use Git, encryption, and signatures as a long-term integrity record across devices or environments.

---

## Outline

### 1. Hook

> “Git doesn’t just track code — it can track truth.”

### 2. Why Use Git

* Immutable commits + cryptographic history = perfect fit for integrity trails.

### 3. Linux Walkthrough

* Initialize encrypted repo:

  ```bash
  git init ~/.prooftrail
  git-crypt init
  git-crypt add-gpg-user you@example.com
  ```
* Rotate keys quarterly.
* Automate commit via cron.

### 4. QubesOS Dom0 Walkthrough

* Keep `.prooftrail` in Dom0, replicate proofs from qubes:

  ```bash
  qvm-run --pass-io work "cat ~/.prooftrail/latest.age" > ~/.prooftrail/work-latest.age
  git add work-latest.age
  git commit -S -m "Work VM proof update"
  git push origin main
  ```
* Hardware-sign commits with YubiKey for extra trust.

### 5. Optional: Offline Backup

* Export signed commits to Vault qube or USB:

  ```bash
  qvm-run --pass-io vault 'cat > ~/prooftrail.tar.gz' < ~/.prooftrail.tar.gz
  ```
* Vault verifies chain integrity:

  ```bash
  minisign -V -p ~/.keys/dom0.pub -m prooftrail.tar.gz
  ```

### 6. Takeaway

> “Now your system has a paper trail of trust — cryptographically notarized, distributed, and human-readable.”

### 7. ProofTrail Teaser

> “Next: integrating these concepts into the full ProofTrail framework — where verification becomes automatic.”
