# 🧩 **ProofTrail 2 — “Signed Integrity: Turning Hashes Into Evidence”**

### 🎯 Goal

Move from *knowing what changed* to *proving who verified it* using digital signatures.

---

## Outline

### 1. Hook

> “A hash is honesty. A signature is accountability.”

### 2. Why Signatures Matter

* Hash files can be replaced.
* Signatures authenticate your baseline as “known good.”

### 3. Linux Walkthrough

```bash
minisign -S -s ~/.keys/sys.key -m ~/.prooftrail/baseline.hashes
minisign -V -p ~/.keys/sys.pub -m ~/.prooftrail/baseline.hashes
```

### 4. QubesOS Dom0 Walkthrough

* Store signing key in Dom0 or a dedicated “Vault” qube.
* Dom0 signs baselines for other qubes:

  ```bash
  qvm-run -p work "sha256sum /etc/hostname" > work.hash
  minisign -S -s ~/.keys/dom0.key -m work.hash
  ```
* Verification:

  ```bash
  minisign -V -p ~/.keys/dom0.pub -m work.hash
  ```

### 5. Takeaway

> “Now your baselines aren’t just snapshots — they’re testimony.”

### 6. ProofTrail Teaser

> “Next, we’ll chain these proofs together over time — building memory into integrity.”
