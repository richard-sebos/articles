Perfect — that’s exactly the kind of systemization that keeps your momentum sustainable.
Let’s outline the **requirements** for the content dashboard so when you open the new chat, we can go straight into building it cleanly (Notion, Google Sheets, or Markdown — whichever you choose).

# 🧭 **ProofTrail Publishing Dashboard Requirements**

## 🎯 **Purpose**

To serve as your **command center** for managing:

* Article development across *Legacy* and *ProofTrail* series
* *Breadcrumb/teaser* posts scheduling and linking
* Cross-platform posting and repost rotation
* Engagement tracking (views, comments, CTR)

## 🧩 **Core Functional Goals**

| Category                   | Description                                                                                        | Example                                               |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Content Tracking**       | Track all articles by code (SMB, ADE, QDE, PRF) with title, topic, and state                       | `SMB-002 – Samba Global Config – Draft`               |
| **Publishing Schedule**    | Maintain one view of all planned publish dates (Sunday → Legacy/ProofTrail, midweek → Breadcrumbs) | “PRF-002 goes live Nov 23; breadcrumb teaser Nov 20.” |
| **Breadcrumb Linkage**     | Each breadcrumb post links to one full article (Legacy or ProofTrail)                              | “Breadcrumb 1 → PRF-003”                              |
| **Cross-Platform Planner** | Columns for where each piece will publish: LinkedIn, Mastodon, dev.to, blog                        |                                                       |
| **Repost Rotation**        | Track 7-day repost plan for legacy articles                                                        | “Day 3: 10 groups posted”                             |
| **Status Progression**     | Standard workflow from `Idea → Draft → Pre-Pub → Published → Reposted`                             | Visual progress bar or dropdown                       |
| **Engagement Metrics**     | Optional columns for tracking performance                                                          | Views, Likes, Comments, CTR                           |
| **Content Tags**           | Thematic tagging (Verification / Containment / Automation / Crypto)                                | For sorting and reuse later                           |

## 🧠 **Non-Functional Goals**

* Must be **simple and fast** to update (low friction).
* Should support **filtering by tag, series, or week**.
* Must **highlight upcoming deadlines** automatically (via conditional formatting or icons).
* Easy export to Markdown or CSV for archival.

---

## 🔐 **Optional Advanced Features**

If you want to grow it later:

* Auto-pull post stats via API (LinkedIn, Mastodon, dev.to)
* Integration with Hootsuite/Buffer for post scheduling
* “Idea vault” tab — quick dump of post hooks and breadcrumbs to develop later
* “Content rotation tracker” for reposted legacy articles (checkboxes by group/day)

---

## 🚀 **Deliverable for the Next Chat**

In the next window, we’ll **build your dashboard template** (in Markdown, Google Sheets, or Notion — your choice).
It will include:

* Pre-filled sample data from your current roadmap
* Calendar logic for article + breadcrumb scheduling
* Filters for series, platform, and publish status

Before we switch over, confirm:
👉 Would you prefer the dashboard built in **Google Sheets**, **Notion**, or **Markdown format** (editable table in Obsidian/GitHub)?
