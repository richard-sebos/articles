SSH isn’t just for remote shell access — it’s a gateway to secure, flexible networking. In this deep-dive blog post, I cover **SSH Tunneling**, showing you how to encrypt non-SSH traffic (like RDP, FTP, and more), bypass firewalls, and simplify your workflows using `.ssh/config`.

Whether you're securing legacy protocols or navigating tricky network setups, SSH tunneling has you covered.

### Normal Facebook - Ansible in DevOps
🛡️ **Secure More Than Just Shell Access with SSH Tunneling**

Hey team,
Just dropped a new article that expands on SSH ProxyJump (which I covered in a previous post) — this time, we’re diving into **SSH Tunneling**, and why it should be part of your DevOps and automation playbook.

Whether you're managing remote RDP access, securing internal services, or automating environments with Ansible, SSH Tunneling lets you:

🔹 Encrypt traffic from non-secure apps like VNC or FTP
🔹 Route traffic around firewall restrictions (legit use cases!)
🔹 Secure remote access in hybrid/cloud environments
🔹 Simplify port-forward setups via `~/.ssh/config`

And yes, it plays **very well with Ansible**, especially when you're dealing with dynamic inventories or restricted networks.

🔥 Real examples included (RDP over SSH), plus how to make it reusable and clean with `.ssh/config`.

Let me know if you’ve baked SSH tunnels into your Ansible playbooks—or used them to solve edge-case access issues.

🔐 **SSH Tunneling: Going Beyond Secure Shell Access**


In my last article, we explored SSH ProxyJump as a way to streamline access through jump hosts. This time, I’m diving into another powerful and often underused SSH feature: **SSH Tunneling**.

If you're a Red Hat admin responsible for managing internal services—think RDP, VNC, FTP, or legacy systems—you should have SSH Tunneling in your toolbox. It lets you **encrypt nearly any traffic** over SSH, giving you an extra layer of protection without the complexity of VPNs or third-party tools.

✅ Encrypt unprotected protocols

✅ Bypass firewalls cleanly

✅ Secure remote access to internal resources

✅ Use `.ssh/config` to keep it all manageable

I’ve broken down each type—Local, Remote, and Dynamic port forwarding—and included real-world examples and config tips to get you up and running fast.

If you're managing systems in cloud, hybrid, or air-gapped environments, or just want to harden your remote access practices, this is worth a look.

💬 Have you used SSH tunneling in production? Any clever use cases?
