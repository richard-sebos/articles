## 🔹 LinkedIn – Main Profile

> Not every Linux user is equal — and their security policies shouldn’t be either.
> In this article, I walk through how I break down password, account, and MFA policies for:
> • handheld / RF devices
> • business users
> • app devs & admins
> • system admins
>
> It’s less “one policy to rule them all” and more “secure the way they actually work.”

If you want, I can also:

* Draft a **1–2 sentence reusable tagline** for all your “user security / SSH / AIDE” posts
* Create a **short, reusable CTA block** you can paste at the end of each teaser to keep your branding consistent across platforms.
