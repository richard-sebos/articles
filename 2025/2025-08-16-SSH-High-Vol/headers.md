Got it üëç ‚Äî for **dev.to** and a **Jekyll (Chrimpy) site**, you‚Äôll want proper **front matter headers** at the top of your Markdown file. These headers help define metadata like title, description, tags, and canonical URL.

Here are two examples you can drop in:

---

### üîπ Dev.to Header

```yaml
---
title: "Optimizing SSH for High-Volume Environments"
published: true
description: "A practical test of SSH server tuning for environments with hundreds or thousands of connections. Covers MaxStartups, system tuning, and how SSH multiplexing revealed the real performance bottleneck."
tags: ssh, linux, devops, networking, performance
canonical_url: null
cover_image: null
series: "SSH Performance Tuning"
---
```

---

### üîπ Jekyll (Chrimpy) Header

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Optimizing SSH for High-Volume Environments"
date: 2025-08-17 12:00:00 +0000
categories: [Linux, SSH, Performance]
tags: [ssh, linux, devops, sysadmin, networking, performance]
excerpt: "Exploring SSH tuning for high-volume environments and discovering how SSH multiplexing outperforms traditional server tweaks."
image: /assets/images/ssh-performance.png
author: "Your Name"
---
```

‚úÖ **Tips:**

* On **dev.to**, `tags` are limited to **4 max**, so choose wisely.
* On **Jekyll**, you can use as many tags as you like.
* If you add a **cover image**, make sure it‚Äôs properly hosted (e.g., `/assets/images/ssh-performance.png` for Jekyll or a full URL for dev.to).
* `canonical_url` on dev.to can point to your Jekyll blog if you want to make **Jekyll the primary source**.

Would you like me to also generate a **short SEO-friendly meta description** and **Open Graph (social share) preview text** so it looks polished on Twitter/LinkedIn?
