# SSH Key Rotation
# -----------------------------

# Disable the use of static per-user authorized_keys files
# This ensures SSH keys are NOT loaded from ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
# and forces the use of the AuthorizedKeysCommand instead.
AuthorizedKeysFile none

# Specify the command used to retrieve a user's authorized SSH keys dynamically
# This script is responsible for outputting only non-expired SSH public keys
# for the given username. If no key is output, SSH login is denied.
AuthorizedKeysCommand /usr/local/bin/ssh-key-expiry-check

# Set the user under which the AuthorizedKeysCommand script will be executed
# It should be a low-privilege user with read-only access to key data (e.g., a JSON file)
# This prevents the script from being a security risk if misconfigured.
AuthorizedKeysCommandUser nobody
