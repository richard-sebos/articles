🚀 Robots + Network Security = Smarter Systems

Monitoring your robot’s network traffic isn't just about safety—it’s about understanding *how* your system behaves in the real world. We’ve taken Suricata, a powerful open-source IDS tool, and applied it to robotics to track ROS 2 communication and catch network anomalies.

🔍 See how we're using custom rules and Python log distillers to decode what your robot is really saying on the network.

👾 Ever wondered who—or what—your robot is talking to?

We're using Suricata, a deep packet inspection tool, to monitor every byte of ROS 2 traffic, SSH attempts, and more. With a few custom rules and a Python script to clean up the noise, we're turning raw traffic into actionable insights. 🔎

If you're building robots or connected devices, you need to see this!

🔐 How do you monitor what your robot says over the network?

Using Suricata + custom Python logs, we’re capturing, filtering, and understanding every ROS 2 interaction and network anomaly.

Secure robotics starts with visibility. Check out how we do it:
