Absolutely — since you already have the **`qm` article**, let’s update the article series to reflect that. Here’s a **refined outline** for the rest of the articles with your existing `qm` coverage as the base.

## 📚 Updated ROS2 Security Sandbox Article Series

---

### ✅ **✅ Article 1: \[Already Written]**

### **Title:** *“Automating VM Creation with Proxmox `qm` and Ubuntu Autoinstall”*

**Focus:**
How to script a basic Proxmox VM using `qm` and boot it with Ubuntu's autoinstall.

---

### ✍️ Article 2: **“Creating a Secure VM with Ubuntu Autoinstall”**

**Goal:**
Extend autoinstall to **harden the OS from first boot** using best security practices.

**Key Concepts:**

* Lock down user access (`disable_root`, SSH off, password hash)
* Install security tools via `autoinstall.yaml`: `clamav`, `yara`, `auditd`, etc.
* Enable firewall (`ufw`) and restrict outbound access
* Use `late-commands` to enforce post-install security states

**Extras:**

* Snapshot after provisioning
* `qm` CLI firewall setup example
* Compare default vs hardened `autoinstall.yaml`

**Takeaway:**

> “This article builds on automated VM provisioning by showing how to embed Zero Trust principles directly into your base image.”

---

### 🧱 Article 3: **“Building an Isolated Sandbox for File Analysis”**

**Goal:**
Design a secure **environment for malware or suspicious file analysis** using Proxmox + your hardened VM.

**Key Concepts:**

* VM isolation strategies:

  * No shared clipboard or USB
  * No LAN access (only temporary HTTP/HTTPS)
  * No guest-agent
* Network options:

  * NAT only
  * Bridged but blocked with Proxmox firewall
  * Optional VLAN tagging
* Snapshot and rollback for clean state

**Visuals/Examples:**

* Proxmox UI network/firewall rules
* CLI rules with `iptables` or `qm set`

**Takeaway:**

> “A secure sandbox starts with network isolation, system hardening, and careful control over data flow.”

---

### 🧪 Article 4: **“Safely Analyzing Suspicious Files in Your Linux Sandbox”**

**Goal:**
Walk through tools and practices to examine untrusted files safely.

**Key Concepts:**

* Static analysis tools:

  * `file`, `strings`, `hexyl`, `exiftool`, `yara`
* Antivirus scanning:

  * `clamav`, `rkhunter`
* Behavioral monitoring (optional):

  * `auditd`, `inotify-tools`, `tcpdump`
* Example: step-by-step triage of a fake suspicious file

**Takeaway:**

> “Use open-source tools and isolation best practices to safely explore the behavior of unknown files.”

---

### 🔄 (Optional) Article 5: **“Resetting & Repeating: Snapshot, Restore, and Automate VM Cleanup”**

**Goal:**
Ensure your sandbox can be reset to a known-good state easily and repeatedly.

**Key Concepts:**

* Proxmox snapshots (CLI + GUI)
* Rollback workflow:

  ```bash
  qm stop 9001
  qm rollback 9001 clean-state
  qm start 9001
  ```
* Alternatives: LVM thin provisioning, overlay filesystems, or rebuild with autoinstall

**Takeaway:**

> “An effective sandbox is only useful if you can trust it’s clean — every time you use it.”
