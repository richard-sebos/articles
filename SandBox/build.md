✅ The script and configuration are now set up in the canvas as **`Proxmox Autoinstall Sandbox`**. Here’s what you have:

---

### 📄 What’s Included:

#### 🔧 `create_sandbox_vm.sh`:

* Automatically sets up an **Ubuntu-based hardened sandbox VM** in Proxmox.
* Serves a **secure autoinstall config** via a Python HTTP server.
* Installs tools like `clamav`, `yara`, `wireshark`, and `auditd`.
* Enforces `ufw`, disables SSH, and prepares the system for security testing.

### 🧱 Next Steps for You:

1. **Update the password hash** in the script:

   ```bash
   mkpasswd -m sha-512
   ```

   Replace the `"password"` line with your actual hashed password.

2. **Place the Ubuntu Server ISO** in `/var/lib/vz/template/iso/` if not already.

3. **Run the script** on your Proxmox node:

   ```bash
   chmod +x create_sandbox_vm.sh
   ./create_sandbox_vm.sh
   ```

4. **Start the VM and edit GRUB** on first boot:
   Add to kernel line:

   ```
   autoinstall ds=nocloud-net;s=http://<your-proxmox-ip>:8080/
   ```

5. Press **Ctrl+X** to start the unattended install.
