Here‚Äôs your **merged and updated article outline**, combining the **introductory Samba guide for Oracle Linux 9** with the **secure share, SELinux, and permission-based setup** we've built today. This structure gives you a solid Part 1 for your series that balances **introductory walkthrough** with **practical security for business use**.

# üìù Draft Article Outline

## **"Samba on Oracle Linux 9: Secure File Sharing for Mixed Environments"**

> *Enable secure, controlled file sharing across Windows and Linux clients using Samba. This guide walks you through a real-world setup with group permissions, SELinux, and access control.*

---

### üß≠ **1. Introduction**

* Tie into previous CUPS security series (if relevant).
* Emphasize need for file sharing in mixed OS environments (Linux + Windows).
* Samba as a business-grade tool: cost-effective, interoperable, secure.

---

### üì¶ **2. What is Samba?**

* SMB/CIFS protocol support
* Common business use cases:

  * Replace Windows file server
  * Provide cross-platform file access
  * Enforce role-based access control

---

### üñ•Ô∏è **3. Setup Environment**

* OS: Oracle Linux 9 (RHEL-compatible)
* Services: `smb`, `nmb`
* Security: SELinux enforcing, firewalld active

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **4. Install Samba and Start Services**

```bash
sudo dnf install samba samba-client samba-common -y
sudo systemctl enable --now smb nmb
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=samba
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

---

### üóÇÔ∏è **5. Plan and Create Share Structure**

```bash
/srv/samba/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/   # Collaborative team access
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ secure/   # Restricted access for sensitive data
```

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /srv/samba/shared /srv/samba/secure
```

---

### üë• **6. Set Up Users and Groups**

```bash
# Create users
sudo useradd smbuser
sudo smbpasswd -a smbuser

# Optional: Create additional users/groups
sudo groupadd finance
sudo usermod -aG finance smbuser

# Assign group ownership
sudo chown :finance /srv/samba/secure
sudo chmod 770 /srv/samba/secure
```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **7. Configure `smb.conf` for Secure and Open Shares**

```ini
[global]
   workgroup = WORKGROUP
   security = user
   map to guest = Bad User

[Shared]
   path = /srv/samba/shared
   browsable = yes
   writable = yes
   guest ok = yes
   read only = no

[SecureShare]
   path = /srv/samba/secure
   valid users = @finance
   guest ok = no
   writable = yes
```

```bash
sudo systemctl restart smb
```

---

### üõ°Ô∏è **8. SELinux Integration**

Explain how SELinux blocks unauthorized Samba access by default.

```bash
sudo semanage fcontext -a -t samba_share_t "/srv/samba(/.*)?"
sudo restorecon -Rv /srv/samba
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** You likely do *not* need to enable `samba_export_all_rw`. Using `semanage` and `samba_share_t` is more secure and preferred.

---

### üß™ **9. Test Share Access**

#### From Linux:

```bash
smbclient -L //<server-ip> -U smbuser
smbclient //192.168.35.42/SecureShare -U smbuser
```

#### From Windows:

Open `\\<server-ip>\SecureShare` and login with the Samba credentials.

### üß∞ **10. Troubleshooting**

| Error                        | Cause                | Fix                                              |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `NT_STATUS_BAD_NETWORK_NAME` | Incorrect share name | Match exactly as in `smb.conf`                   |
| `NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED`    | Wrong user or perms  | Ensure user is in `valid users`, has file access |
| Cannot access share          | SELinux denial       | Set `samba_share_t` context                      |

Check logs:

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/samba/log.smbd
```

---

### ‚úÖ **11. Conclusion**

* You‚Äôve now built a **secure, business-ready Samba setup**.
* Introduced secure shares, SELinux config, group-based access.
* Ready for next steps: **ACLs**, **AD integration**, or **audit logging**.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

| Concern                 | Action                                                |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Guest Access**        | Disable for production; use authenticated users only  |
| **SELinux Contexts**    | Use `chcon -t samba_share_t /your/share` or setsebool |
| **Firewall Zones**      | Ensure Samba is allowed **only** in trusted zones     |
| **SMB Version Control** | Use `min protocol = SMB2` in `[global]` section       |
| **User Access Control** | Limit with `valid users` and filesystem permissions   |

## üìã Test Checklist

| Test                    | Command                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Verify share is visible | `smbclient -L //<server-ip>`                     |
| Connect anonymously     | `smbclient //<server-ip>/Shared -U guest`        |
| Connect with user       | `smbclient //<server-ip>/SecureShare -U smbuser` |
| View logs               | `sudo tail -f /var/log/samba/log.smbd`           |
