Excellent — Samba is a great follow-up to your CUPS security series, especially since it's another essential service in mixed environments where **Linux needs to interoperate with Windows clients**.

Below is a **structured draft article** you can personalize, polish, and publish as part of your series. It introduces Samba for business users, outlines practical use cases, and walks through installation and a basic share configuration on **Oracle Linux 9** (RHEL-based).

# 🗂️ Introduction to Samba on Oracle Linux 9 for Secure Business File Sharing

> *"Learn what Samba is, how it enables Linux–Windows file sharing, and how to install and configure it securely on Oracle Linux 9."*

---

## 📘 What is Samba?

**Samba** is a free, open-source implementation of the **SMB (Server Message Block)** protocol used primarily for:

* File and print sharing with **Windows clients**
* Joining Linux servers to **Active Directory domains**
* Acting as a **domain controller** or a **member server**
* Enabling **interoperability** in mixed OS environments

### 🔧 Typical Business Use Cases

* Centralized file server for Windows desktops
* Replace or supplement a Windows Server with a Linux-based SMB server
* Allow secure, controlled access to shared directories (read-only, per-group access, etc.)
* Authenticate users via local Linux accounts, or Active Directory

---

## 🖥️ Environment

* **OS:** Oracle Linux 9 (similar to RHEL9 / CentOS Stream 9)
* **Service:** `smb` / `nmb` via `samba` and `samba-client` packages
* **Firewall:** firewalld (zone-based management)
* **Security:** SELinux enabled (default enforcing)

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step: Install and Configure Samba

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Install Samba Packages

```bash
sudo dnf install samba samba-client samba-common -y
```

Verify installation:

```bash
rpm -q samba
```

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Create a Directory to Share

For example, create a shared directory for a department:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /srv/samba/shared
sudo chown -R nobody:nobody /srv/samba/shared
sudo chmod -R 0775 /srv/samba/shared
```

> *This sets up an open share for testing. You can later apply user/group restrictions.*

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Backup and Edit Samba Config

```bash
sudo cp /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.bak
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

Append this basic share configuration:

```ini
[global]
   workgroup = WORKGROUP
   security = user
   map to guest = Bad User

[Shared]
   path = /srv/samba/shared
   browsable = yes
   writable = yes
   guest ok = yes
   read only = no
```

> *This creates an anonymous share accessible from the network.*

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Enable and Start Samba Services

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now smb nmb
```

Check status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status smb nmb
```

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Open the Firewall for Samba

If firewalld is active:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=samba
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

---

### 🔹 Step 6: Verify the Share is Reachable

From a Linux or Windows client on the same network:

#### 🔹 From Linux:

```bash
smbclient -L //<server-ip>/Shared -U guest
```

#### 🔹 From Windows:

* Open File Explorer
* Go to `\\<server-ip>\Shared`

> *If prompted, you can use `guest` or no username.*

---

### 🔹 Step 7: (Optional) Create User-Based Access

For controlled access:

```bash
sudo useradd smbuser
sudo smbpasswd -a smbuser
sudo mkdir -p /srv/samba/secure
sudo chown smbuser:smbuser /srv/samba/secure
```

Update `smb.conf`:

```ini
[SecureShare]
   path = /srv/samba/secure
   valid users = smbuser
   guest ok = no
   writable = yes
```

Then reload:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart smb
```

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

| Concern                 | Action                                                |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Guest Access**        | Disable for production; use authenticated users only  |
| **SELinux Contexts**    | Use `chcon -t samba_share_t /your/share` or setsebool |
| **Firewall Zones**      | Ensure Samba is allowed **only** in trusted zones     |
| **SMB Version Control** | Use `min protocol = SMB2` in `[global]` section       |
| **User Access Control** | Limit with `valid users` and filesystem permissions   |

## 📋 Test Checklist

| Test                    | Command                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Verify share is visible | `smbclient -L //<server-ip>`                     |
| Connect anonymously     | `smbclient //<server-ip>/Shared -U guest`        |
| Connect with user       | `smbclient //<server-ip>/SecureShare -U smbuser` |
| View logs               | `sudo tail -f /var/log/samba/log.smbd`           |
