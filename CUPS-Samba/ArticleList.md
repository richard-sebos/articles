Here‚Äôs a clean list of the **15 article topics** in your CUPS and Samba series, with PAM integrated where applicable:

---

### üî¢ **CUPS Series**

1. **CUPS: What It Is and How It's Used**

   * Overview of CUPS architecture, protocols (IPP, AirPrint), typical home lab/server use cases.

2. **Securing CUPS** *(with PAM)*

   * Enabling SSL, restricting admin access via PAM groups, sandboxing filters, firewall considerations.

3. **Fail2Ban and CUPS** *(with PAM)*

   * Protecting the web admin interface from brute-force attacks using Fail2Ban, tied into PAM authentication logs.

4. **Samba and CUPS Integration**

   * Sharing CUPS-managed printers via Samba for Windows clients; configuration examples and compatibility notes.

### üìÅ **Samba Series**

5. **Samba and User Shares**

   * Creating secure user shares, using group permissions, and managing ACLs.

6. **Securing Samba** *(with PAM)*

   * Disabling SMB1, enforcing SMB signing, integrating PAM for login restrictions and multifactor policies.

7. **Samba User Authentication with Active Directory** *(with PAM)*

   * Domain integration, Kerberos, and mapping AD groups to PAM policies.

8. **Samba with Kerberos Authentication** *(with PAM)*

   * Using `pam_krb5.so`, ticket validation, and enforcing ticket lifetimes.

9. **Creating Samba Shares for Tiered Users** *(with PAM)*

   * Per-tier access controls, using `pam_succeed_if.so` and group-based restrictions.

10. **Hardening Samba with AppArmor or SELinux**

* Applying MAC policies to protect shares, log access, and restrict unauthorized paths.

11. **Using Fail2Ban with Samba** *(with PAM)*

* Monitoring `/var/log/samba` or journalctl for brute-force attempts; optional PAM integration.

12. **Samba and Syslog: Centralized Access Logging** *(with PAM)*

* Structured logging with PAM hooks (`pam_exec.so`) and Samba audit modules for SIEM pipelines.

### üîê **Conceptual + Advanced**

13. **PAM-Enabled File and Print Infrastructure: A Tiered Security Model**

* Blueprint article uniting Samba, CUPS, and PAM into a secure access framework for multi-role environments.

14. **Zero Trust for Print and File Services**

* Designing printer/file sharing in modern segmented, policy-driven networks. Emphasis on protocol control, isolation, and auth.

15. **Red vs Blue: Exploiting vs Defending CUPS and Samba**

* Attacker techniques and defender mitigations. Useful for blue-teamers looking to threat model legacy services.
