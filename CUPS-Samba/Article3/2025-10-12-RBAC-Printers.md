## Securing Printers with CUPS: Why It Matters

As a Linux administrator, you often find yourself tackling some surprising tasks—and printer management is definitely one of them. For me, it all started with three CUPS servers managing over 50 printers. Thankfully, CUPS was relatively easy to work with at a high level. But as the infrastructure grew from 3 to 7 servers and over a hundred printers spread across the country, I started wondering: should a user on the East Coast really be able to see and print to a West Coast printer?

That simple question led me down a path of exploring how CUPS handles access control, and more importantly, how it can be secured at the **printer level**.

## Why You Should Care

CUPS (Common UNIX Printing System) is deceptively straightforward. It offers a lot of flexibility and user-friendliness—great traits until you realize that same ease of use can lead to potential security issues. Sure, it's handy when users can check the status of their print jobs or see printer queues. But what if they can pause a printer, cancel someone else’s jobs, or worse—delete the printer entirely?

Now imagine a malicious actor gaining access. Without proper controls, they could cause real damage—deleting jobs, changing printer configurations, or accessing sensitive documents. Thankfully, CUPS offers built-in role-based access control (RBAC) features that allow you to manage who can print, where print jobs can come from, and who can see or modify printers—all at the **individual printer level**.

## Understanding Printer-Level RBAC in CUPS

### Controlling Where Print Jobs Can Come From

Today, you might have specialized printers—like those printing shipping labels or receipts—connected to your network. Ideally, these printers are on isolated subnets behind strict firewall rules. But even so, CUPS gives you fine-grained control over who can send print jobs.

You can define restrictions in `cupsd.conf` that allow only specific IP addresses to send jobs to a particular printer. For example, a shipping label printer may only need to accept jobs from the order processing system and the local host:

```conf
## Restrictions for Shipping Label Printer
## Inside of cupsd.conf
<Location /printers/SH_LABEL_IL_01>
  AuthType Basic
  Require ip 10.10.1.10         # Order system
  Require ip 127.0.0.1          # Localhost
</Location>
```

This ensures that only authorized systems can send print jobs to that printer, reducing the attack surface significantly.

### Controlling Who Can Print

In a [previous article](https://richard-sebos.github.io/sebostechnology/posts/CUPS-RBAC/), I discussed how to restrict access to the CUPS web interface at a global level. However, CUPS also allows for similar restrictions **per printer**. This becomes especially useful for sensitive devices like check printers.

You can assign access to specific users or groups using the `Require user` or `Require group` directives in the printer configuration. For example, only members of the `ap_sup` (Accounts Payable Supervisors) group should be able to print checks:

```conf
<Printer AP_CHECKS>
  PrinterId 10
  Require group ap_sup
  ...
</Printer>
```

Not only does this limit who can send jobs, but it also limits who can view those jobs—helping protect sensitive information.
